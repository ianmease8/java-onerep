# Overview


I wanted to learn a little bit more about java and get a feel for the syntax of the language

I built a software that can be used to calculate one rep maxes based of a weight and how many reps
you can do the weight for, this allowed me to figure out how to write equations for loops as well as build different classes within java, this really helped me to get a feel for the language and how to write code using it


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
I used a scanner which is how java gets information from the user, it works similar to the built in function of input in python
{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
I used java as the main programming language
I used a couple math formatting and utilites as well as a java arraylist

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I would like to add an additional print out, to where it actually takes the information and writes it to a file to be printed
* I would like to make it more user controlled, so that they can specify how many lifts they would like to do
* I would also like to make the classes more class like, the inheritance between the classes is a little jumbled and not a good standard.
